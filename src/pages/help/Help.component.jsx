			<H1>FAQ</H1>
			<H2>General</H2>
			<H3>What is Top?</H3>
			<P>
				Top is an online marketplace dedicated to sneakers. Unlike a retailer,
				stock levels on the Top marketplace are entirely dependent on whether or
				not there are users selling the shoe. Top acts as the middleman between
				buyer and seller, offering a streamlined authentication process and
				timely delivery. To ensure each and every pair is 100% authentic, Top
				has a dedicated team of in-house authenticators that thoroughly check
				every pair before they land in the buyer's hands.
			</P>
			<H3>How do I create an account with Top?</H3>
			<P>
				On our website under the heading 'log in', there will be an option to
				either log in to an existing account, or sign up and create a new
				account using a valid email address and password.
			</P>
			<H3>Are all items authentic?</H3>
			<P>
				All items sold on Top are 100% authentic and brand new in the original
				box. Once a pair has sold, it is sent to our authentication centre where
				our team of experts check every detail to ensure every pair is genuine
				and unworn. Once verified, our team sends the pair to the buyer.
			</P>
			<H3>How can I contact Top?</H3>
			<P>
				You can contact us by emailing help@top.co.uk. Once you email us, a
				ticket will be raised with our dedicated customer service team and
				they'll get back to you as soon as possible. Please ensure you only send
				one email per enquiry.
			</P>
			<H3>Do you offer discounts and promo codes?</H3>
			<P>
				At this moment in time, Top does not offer any discounts or promo codes.
				Any future offers, discounts or promotions will be sent out to customers
				via email. To ensure you don't miss out, create an account with Top and
				opt in to our email newsletter.
			</P>
			<H3>Is Top an anonymous marketplace?</H3>
			<P>
				Both buyers and sellers remain anonymous throughout every transaction,
				meaning only Top can see the identity of both parties. Every transaction
				is handled safely and securely and Top will not at any time reveal the
				identity of any buyer or seller.
			</P>
			<H3>Can I withdraw money from my account in any currency?</H3>
			<P>
				All funds will be paid out in GBP. If your account is not a GBP account,
				the funds will be converted to your local currency. If you are not
				located in the UK and wish to add a GBP account, please contact us at
				help@top.co.uk before attempting to withdraw funds.
			</P>
			<H3>I'm having issues withdrawing funds from my account?</H3>
			<P>
				Please check your Top account and ensure all your details are correct.
				On some occasions, our payment processor may not be able to verify your
				identity with the information you have provided. If this happens, we may
				request additional information from you. Please email our customer
				service team at help@top.co.uk for assistance.
			</P>
			<H3>What is the authentication process for products?</H3>
			<P>
				Once you make a purchase, the seller of the product sends it to our
				warehouse. Here, our dedicated team of experts check every little detail
				to ensure the product is 100% authentic, unworn and in its original box.
				If the product fails authentication, it'll be rejected and sent back to
				the seller and the buyer will be issued a full refund. If it passes,
				it'll be sent straight on to the buyer.
			</P>
			<H3>Claim / Carrier issue</H3>
			<P>
				If your item was marked as delivered but you didn't receive it, we
				recommend checking with your neighbours and anyone else that lives at
				your residence, in case they collected it on your behalf. If you still
				can't locate the parcel, reach out to help@top.co.uk with your order
				number and tracking number within three business days of the delivery
				date to remain eligible for a claim. Do not start a claim on your own
				with the delivery company, otherwise we will not be able to assist
				further and you may no longer be eligible for a refund. Please note if
				you have made changes to your delivery through a carrier service (e.g.
				UPS My Choice), you may no longer be eligible for a claim.
			</P>
			<H2>Buying</H2>
			<H3>What is the delivery timeframe for the UK?</H3>
			<P>
				Our average delivery time is around 6-12 working days, but around Black
				Friday and Christmas it can take a little longer due to the volume of
				orders and potential delays with delivery companies. Once you've made an
				order, we'll update you regularly and let you know as soon as possible
				if we or the delivery company expect any delays. We strongly recommend
				you place any and all holiday orders sooner rather than later to ensure
				plenty of time for delivery.
			</P>
			<H3>Will I receive my shoes if it's a bank holiday?</H3>
			<P>
				Bank holiday weekends are among our busiest periods of the year. We will
				always strive to get your delivery to you on time, but expect some
				delays. To avoid these delays, we recommend ordering your shoes at least
				three weeks before. Always check our site and socials for updates on
				delivery deadlines. What is the delivery timeframe for international
				orders? Worldwide shipping usually takes between 6-14 days, but it can
				sometimes take a little longer around Black Friday and Christmas due to
				the volume of orders we receive. Since the UK has left the EU, a few
				changes have been made which can affect the timing of your delivery.
				Import taxes have now been enforced. All shipping costs are calculated
				at checkout and customers are responsible for any additional customs
				fees and taxes, which are decided based on your region. Top is not
				responsible for any extra fees or charges that may incur once your order
				reaches you. So, before ordering, we recommend you check with your
				customs office and pay any costs as soon as possible to avoid any
				potential delays.
			</P>
			<H3>Does Top offer next-day delivery?</H3>
			<P>
				Top doesn't currently offer next-day delivery. Once you've bought your
				shoes, the seller has strictly two working days to send them to our
				authentication centre where our in-house team of expert authenticators
				check them over to ensure they're genuine and box-fresh. The shoes are
				usually checked by our team the same day they arrive in the warehouse,
				then they are shipped via next-day delivery once successfully
				authenticated. This whole process leads to delivery taking on average
				between 6-14 days.
			</P>
			<H3>Can I pay more for express delivery?</H3>
			<P>
				Top currently offers just one delivery option. This gives our sellers
				enough time to send the product to our authentication centre, where each
				and every product is thoroughly checked. Once authenticated, most orders
				are then sent to the buyer via next-day delivery. This whole process
				leads to delivery taking on average between 6-14 days.
			</P>
			<H3>What happens if I buy a product and the seller doesn't ship?</H3>
			<P>
				When you purchase a product, the seller has two working days to ship the
				item to us. If they do not meet this requirement, the buyer will receive
				a full refund, the seller will be fined and their account with us will
				be suspended.
			</P>
			<H3>
				I received a tracking number but there's no movement, what should I do?
			</H3>
			<P>
				Order tracking is controlled by UPS. Usually, if your package hasn't
				moved, it's still in the UPS network and will arrive on the scheduled
				delivery date unless otherwise stated. The movement of the parcel on
				your tracking is defined by point-to-point scans. Your parcel is scanned
				at every touchpoint from pick-up to delivery, so if your parcel hasn't
				moved in over 24 hours, there may just be a longer gap between the
				scans. This is more likely if the parcel is travelling cross-country.
			</P>
			<H3>Why hasn't my tracking been updated?</H3>
			<P>
				Order tracking is controlled by UPS. Once your order has been verified,
				it can take up to 24 hours for tracking to be updated. If it's been over
				24 hours since your order was verified, and you still haven't received
				an update, check the UPS tracking portal for any delays. You can find
				the link here: https://www.ups.com/track
			</P>
			<H3>Why are sizes priced differently, even if it's the same shoe?</H3>
			<P>
				Top is a marketplace, so each pair is priced independently by the user
				who is selling the shoe. Some sizes are more in-demand than others, so
				will sometimes have a higher price point. It's important to note that
				due to the nature of marketplaces, stock levels, sizes and prices will
				fluctuate and are entirely defined by the seller.
			</P>
			<H3>What is the Top returns policy?</H3>
			<P>
				As a consumer, you have the right to change your mind about a purchase,
				return an item and receive a refund in certain circumstances. To be
				eligible for a return, the product must be in the same unworn condition
				it arrived in. If you change your mind about your order, you'll need to
				email help@top.co.uk with your order number and reason for returning.
				Our team will then arrange a returns label for you and the cost of the
				return (Â£9) will be deducted from your refund. If the reason for your
				return is that the shoe is faulty or there was a change in your order
				from our side, Top will pay for the cost of shipping. See our terms and
				conditions for more information.
			</P>
			<H3>Can I try on my new shoes?</H3>
			<P>
				We recommend being extra careful when trying on your new shoes. If you
				want to return your purchase, the Top authentication tag must still be
				intact and the pair must be in the same unworn condition they arrived
				in. If they're damaged while trying on, your return and refund may be
				rejected.
			</P>
			<H3>How much is the shipping cost for buyers?</H3>
			<P>
				All shipping costs are calculated at checkout and all customers are
				responsible for any customs fees and taxes that may be added, depending
				on your country or region. Top is not responsible for any fees or
				charges you may incur once your order reaches you.
			</P>
			<H3>
				What happens if an item I buy gets flagged during the authentication
				process?
			</H3>
			<P>
				If an item you buy is flagged for any reason during the authentication
				check, you will receive a full refund and the seller of the item will be
				fined and potentially banned from using our site. Alternatively, if the
				same item becomes available at the same or lower price from a different
				seller, we will contact you and purchase this item for you then refund
				the difference.
			</P>
			<H3>Can I buy items in any currency on Top?</H3>
			<P>
				At this moment in time, you can only purchase items on Top in Sterling
				(Â£).
			</P>
			<H2>Selling</H2>
			<H3>What happens if I miss my shipping deadline?</H3>
			<P>
				It's important that our buyers receive their product in a timely manner,
				especially around the holiday period. So, once your product has sold,
				you have strictly two working days to send your shoes to our
				authentication centre. Failure to meet this deadline will result in a
				Â£15.00 penalty fee and any future delays could result in further fines
				and a potential ban from the site.
			</P>
			<H3>How do bank holidays affect shipping deadlines?</H3>
			<P>
				We usually don't count bank holidays as business days. However, there
				are some exceptions to this rule - including Easter and Christmas. To
				ensure you meet your shipping deadline and avoid a penalty fee, it's
				important that you check the shipping email sent to you once your item
				has sold. This will include your specific deadline.
			</P>
			<H3>I'm self isolating and can't ship out my order, what should I do?</H3>
			<P>
				If you're self isolating due to COVID-19 symptoms, we strongly recommend
				that you organise a UPS parcel collection to your home. You can arrange
				same-day pick up, or pre-book it for another day. Once your shoes have
				sold, you have strictly two working days to send the pair onto us for
				authentication. Failure to meet this deadline could result in a penalty
				fee.
			</P>
			<H3>How much is shipping for sellers?</H3>
			<P>
				Shipping costs are calculated based on your region and are displayed
				when you list an item.
			</P>
			<H3>How and when do I get paid when my item sells?</H3>
			<P>
				As soon as your item has passed authentication, the funds become
				available in the âwalletâ section of your account. You can use this
				money as Top credit against other purchases. Alternatively, if you wish
				to withdraw the money, it will be available in your bank account within
				three working days from when you request the withdrawal.
			</P>
			<H3>Can I cancel a trade once an item has sold?</H3>
			<P>
				Once an item is sold, there is no way you can cancel the purchase if you
				change your mind. Therefore, the transaction must be completed in
				conjunction with the T&Cs, ensuring that the item is sent within two
				working days or you risk a fine and potential ban from the site.
			</P>
			<H3>As a seller, can I ship multiple items in one box?</H3>
			<P>
				Currently, sellers aren't able to ship multiple items in one box. If you
				have multiple items that have sold, you must send them in individual
				boxes.
			</P>
			<H3>
				How long does it take for money I withdraw to go into my bank account?
			</H3>
			<P>
				The money you have requested to be withdrawn will be in your bank
				account within 24 hours of the withdrawal request if you require
				Sterling (Â£). However, if you want the funds to be withdrawn in either
				US Dollars ($) or Euros (â¬), it'll take 2-3 working days for this to
				clear.
			</P>
			<H3>
				What happens if an item I am trying to sell gets flagged in the
				authentication process?
			</H3>
			<P>
				If for any reason the item you send to us is flagged, the buyer will
				receive a full refund and your item will be returned to you. You will be
				charged a fee of Â£20 to cover shipping costs back to you. We may also
				charge you a 10% fee of the sale price of the item at our discretion.
			</P>
			<H3>How much is the shipping cost for sellers?</H3>
			<P>For UK sellers it's Â£6.99, and for EU sellers it's Â£15 per item.</P>
			<H3>How much of a percentage of the sale do Top take?</H3>
			<P>
				Our fees are 12% + a 3% payment processing fee. You can see the
				breakdown of fees when listing an item.
			</P>
			<H3>How old do you have to be to sell?</H3>
			<P>You must be at least 18 years old to sell on Top.</P>
			<H3>Account Verification</H3>
			<P>
				To ensure compliance with industry regulations via payment providers and
				for a hassle-free payout experience:
			</P>
			<P>
				If you are selling as an individual in the UK and need to go through
				account verification based on your location, please read the following:
				Please note that the minimum age requirement to get paid is 18 years
				old. If you are a minor, your parents/legal guardian must provide their
				personal information to continue, to ensure compliance with global data
				privacy and payment services regulations; photo identification and proof
				of address upon meeting cumulative payout thresholds.
			</P>
			<P>
				Our support team will be in touch requesting additional identification
				data and/or documentation. The data and/or documentation should only be
				submitted within our email help@top.co.uk. Please respond to the email
				with documentation attached. If you need to go through account
				verification, please note that the address on your ID documents must
				match the billing information on your Top seller profile. If your
				account requires verification, all withdrawal (transfers out of the
				account) will be paused until verification has been successfully
				completed. Once documents are submitted, verification may take 1-3
				business days.
			</P>
